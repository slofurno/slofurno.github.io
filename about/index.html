<p>
Before software I played Dota 2 on a team which could be described as professional. On our way out of the dumpster we participated in many semi-pro and professional tournaments, including the Netolic Pro League, WePlay, Prodota2, and The Defense.

I also co-founded two significant Dota inhouse leagues, fragment and c9dl, in which many professional and upcoming players participated.
