Libmill is a c library for working with coroutines in a style that is simliar to golang, complete with a syntactically similiar version of channels, select statements, and goroutines.

Nanomsg is the reference implementation of the scalability protocols, a set of communications patterns which are used for creating distributed systems.

While you can use them separately, together they show alot of synergy. Libmill operates in the context of a single thread, so you need to avoid blocking. To make this possible, libmill provides nonblocking versions of io functions like reading from a file or sleeping. Nanomsg provides a flag to allow for either blocking or non blocking io calls. Since we don't want to block the thread, we can ask nanomsg for a file descripter which will signal when there is data available. We can combine this with libmill's wait to yield our goroutine until  there is data to be read.

My plan is to build a simple distributed system to process movie files into gifs. Users should be able to upload movie files in common formats eg mp4 or avi, where a broker will distribute the work to the first available worker. This worker will do all the processing, and when its done, will return a gif.

This design is called the <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#advanced-request-reply">load balancing broker</a> Whenever a worker is ready to do more work, it will send a request to our broker. Instead of replying immediately, the broker will queue up this worker until it has work for it to do. The worker's request also serves as an opportunity for the worker to return the result of its last job. When the next job comes in, our broker will get the next worker in the queue and finally send it's reply with the movie file we wish to process.

I will break this system down into 3 main pieces

A collect loop, which gets results from the workers

- receieve worker request
- read uuid + gif body from worker message
- enqueue the worker
- broadcasting the uuid, so the subscribed client knows their gif is ready
- save the gif


A routing loop, which sends jobs to the workers

- wait for next gif request
- dequeue next worker
- reply to worker with request uuid + movie file


a http server, which gets jobs from our clients

- listen for post requests
- receive movie file
- generate uuid
- enqueue gif request
- subscribe to topic uuid
- wait for uuid to be published
